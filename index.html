	<h1>BLACK AND WHITE TATTOOS</h1>
	
	<p>Black and white tattoos are known for their simplistic designs and beauty. They have been prominent since the beginning of tattooing and are what tattooing is most known for. Black and white tattoos are the best because they take less time, have better contrast, last longer, and are much more versatile.</p>

	<p>On the other hand, creating multi-dimensional black/grey tattoos is very tricky, and can only be managed by experienced tattoo artists. The artist will have to use tone, texture, composition, shape, and weight to pull off this type of design. An inexperienced tattoo artist can botch up a multi-dimensional black/.grey tattoo easily.</p>
