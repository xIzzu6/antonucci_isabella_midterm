	<title>Izzu's Argument on Colour Tattoos</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>COLOUR TATTOOS</h1>

	<p>Colour tattoos are known to express and have a much greater statement than black and white ink. They draw more attention to the skin and image because of the flashy colours and intense contrast. I think colour tattoos are much better than black and white tattoos simply because they look cooler. It draws attention and tells a story, where black and white tattoos might not get the image across as easy.</p>

	<p>On the other hand, colour tattoos are more known to fade quicker and take longer to get done. This is due to the complexity of colour tattoos.</p>
